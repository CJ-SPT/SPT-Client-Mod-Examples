SPT-Client-Mod-Boilerplate

Use this as a starting point for your own client mods!

**DO NOT OVERWRITE YOUR .csproj FILE WITH THE ONE IN THIS REPO**

You will need to paste in your refs yourself, there are other bits of information in your .csproj file that you should not overwrite. The one in this repo is only there to visually demonstrate where to put refs, see the comments near the bottom of that file.

If you are pasting code into your own project from the Plugin.cs file, or any file in the Patches folder, **make sure you update "YourModName" to your own mod name, and be sure to replace YourUsername.YourModName with a unique plugin GUID**.
